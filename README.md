# Applied AI Learning

This repository documents my learning journey toward becoming an Applied AI Engineer.
The focus is on understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in real-world
applications, especially backend systems and developer tools.

## What I’m Learning

### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
- LLMs are transformer-based neural networks trained on large text datasets.
- They work by predicting the next token based on context.
- Common use cases include chatbots, summarization, Q&A, and code assistance.

### 2. Prompt Engineering
- Structuring prompts clearly to guide model behavior.
- Using system and user instructions to control tone and output.
- Iterative refinement to improve response quality.

### 3. Embeddings
- Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors.
- These vectors capture semantic meaning.
- Used for similarity search and retrieval tasks.

### 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- RAG combines document retrieval with LLM generation.
- Relevant documents are fetched using vector similarity search.
- Retrieved content is injected into the prompt to reduce hallucination.

### 5. AI + Backend Integration
- LLMs are usually accessed via APIs.
- Backend frameworks like FastAPI or Flask expose AI-powered endpoints.
- AI services are integrated similar to any microservice.

## Mini Experiments (Beginner Level)
- Simple Python scripts for text generation and Q&A
- Understanding API-based AI workflows
- Exploring how AI can be added to existing web applications

## How This Connects to Real Projects
In my full-stack projects, AI can be integrated to:
- Analyze user data and generate insights
- Automate summaries and reports
- Build intelligent assistants for applications

## Tools & Concepts Exploring
- Python
- REST APIs
- OpenAI-style APIs (conceptual)
- Vector search (FAISS / Pinecone – conceptual)
- Git & GitHub

## Goal
To build production-ready AI-powered systems by combining strong software engineering
fundamentals with applied AI concepts.
